# BOTTOM EXPLANATION
# - Responsibility: Central place for runtime config values used by backend code.
# - Key syntax: KEY=VALUE pairs are loaded with dotenv into process.env.
# - Common mistakes: On Windows, `localhost` may resolve in a way that fails; `127.0.0.1` is often more reliable for OpenSearch.
