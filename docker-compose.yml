# BOTTOM EXPLANATION
# - Responsibility: Starts local OpenSearch + OpenSearch Dashboards with security disabled for beginner-friendly local practice.
# - Key syntax: `services` defines containers; `ports` maps host:container; `environment` sets container env vars.
# - Common mistakes: Setting both `DISABLE_SECURITY_PLUGIN=true` and `plugins.security.disabled=true` can duplicate config and stop OpenSearch from booting.
