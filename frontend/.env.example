# HEADER: Environment template for frontend API base URL.
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:4000/api

# BOTTOM EXPLANATION
# - Responsibility: Stores browser-safe frontend env vars prefixed with VITE_.
# - Key syntax: Vite only exposes vars beginning with `VITE_` to client-side code.
# - Common mistakes: Using `API_URL` (without VITE_) makes the value undefined in React app.
